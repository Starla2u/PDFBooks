# Hacking Book PDF Collection  
*A live collection of PDF books based around Hacking & Programming!*  
This is a git repo that I have setup & dedicated to collecting and adding new books that are must reads for virtually everyone that is wanting to get into the Hacking & Programming world!  
All of the books in this repo can be found by doing a simple Google Dork search like so;  
```
Advanced Penetration Testing PDF
```
And there are thousands of results for the PDF Books you can read for free. All I did was compile them all into 1 easy-to-find GitHub repo!  
**BUT WHY?**  
I did this for a personal gain really. I wanted to be able to have a list of PDF books I can read virtually anytime. And anywhere! I can easily pull these up 
on my phone, tablet, laptop, or desktop and start reading.  
  
## Hacking Books  
*The Ultimate Hackers Collection*  
If you are wanting to learn how to be a professional hacker, in this folder you will find a slew of books that are based upon hacking. Sharpen your skills 
and learn new things with these PDF's. Download them for offline reading, and on the go!  
  
## Coding Books  
*Code Hard*  
When we are talking about hacking, we also need to have some understanding of programming. Or maybe you don't care about hacking so much as you do about programming!  
What ever your case is, these books covers it all from Game Development, to Website Development, Mobile Apps, and even web apps!  
  
## Live Collection  
*What the heck is a LIVE COLLECTION?!?!?!*  
Do not fear, and do not worry! As I discover new books from people who would like to learn different things, I add them to the repo! I will do my best to add at least 
2 books every week. Maybe more. Who knows.  
The point is, if you want to learn and grow your knowledge, these books will help you get there!  
  
## Contact & Support
